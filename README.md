# Convolutional-Neural-Network-from-Scratch
Implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks on MNIST data set 

Check out the Live App @ http://madhav.pythonanywhere.com/



An **Optical and Handwritten digit recogniser**. A Convolution Neural Network trained over MNIST data set. 

A **Deep learning Model** made from scratch with only numpy. No other libraries/frameworks were used. 

### Motivation:
As part of my personal journey to gain a better understanding of Deep Learning, Iâ€™ve decided to build a Convolutional Neural Network from scratch without a deep learning library like TensorFlow. I believe that understanding the inner workings of a Neural Network is important to any aspiring Data Scientist.This allowed me to deeply understand every method in my model and gave me a better intution of Neural Networks.



## About MNIST dataset:
The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from [this page](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting. The original black and white (bilevel) images from NIST were size normalized to fit in a 20x20 pixel box while preserving their aspect ratio. The resulting images contain grey levels as a result of the anti-aliasing technique used by the normalization algorithm. the images were centered in a 28x28 image by computing the center of mass of the pixels, and translating the image so as to position this point at the center of the 28x28 field. you can also find dataset [here](https://github.com/madhavambati/Convolutional-Neural-Network-with-Numpy/tree/master/model).
