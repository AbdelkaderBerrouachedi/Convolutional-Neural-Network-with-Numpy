An Optical and Handwritten digit recogniser. A Convolution Neural Network trained over MNIST data set. MNIST data set can be found [here]( http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

A Deep learning Model made from scratch with only numpy. No other libraries/frameworks were used. This allowed me to deeply understand every method in my model and gave me the intution of Neural Networks.
